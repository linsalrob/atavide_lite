# Executables and scripts

These are additional scripts that we need to use for atavide lite. 

Please make the binary files with the following commands before you start using atavide lite. 

```bash
make all
```

Most of the standalone scripts layer additional information into the output files from other code.


# Dependencies

These are some of the dependencies that `atavide\_light` depends upon. You can compile the `C` code by using the [Makefile](Makefile) by typing just `make`.
