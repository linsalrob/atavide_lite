  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Random community genomes (metagenomes) are now
                  commonly used to study microbes in different environments.
                  Over the past few years, the major challenge associated with
                  metagenomics shifted from generating to analyzing sequences.
                  High-throughput, low-cost next-generation sequencing has
                  provided access to metagenomics to a wide range of
                  researchers. RESULTS: A high-throughput pipeline has been
                  constructed to provide high-performance computing to all
                  researchers interested in using metagenomics. The pipeline
                  produces automated functional assignments of sequences in the
                  metagenome by comparing both protein and nucleotide databases.
                  Phylogenetic and functional summaries of the metagenomes are
                  generated, and tools for comparative metagenomics are
                  incorporated into the standard views. User access is
                  controlled to ensure data privacy, but the collaborative
                  environment underpinning the service provides a framework for
                  sharing datasets between multiple users. In the metagenomics
                  RAST, all users retain full control of their data, and
                  everything is available for download in a variety of formats.
                  CONCLUSION: The open-source metagenomics RAST service provides
                  a new paradigm for the annotation and analysis of metagenomes.
                  With built-in support for multiple data sources and a back end
                  that houses abstract data types, the metagenomics RAST is
                  stable, extensible, and freely available to all researchers.
                  This service has removed one of the primary bottlenecks in
                  metagenome sequence analysis - the availability of
                  high-performance computing for annotating the data.

                  metagenomic sequencing experiments requires multiple
                  preprocessing and analytical steps to interpret the microbial
                  and genetic composition of samples. Analytical steps include
                  quality control, adapter trimming, host decontamination,
                  metagenomic classification, read assembly, and alignment to
                  reference genomes. RESULTS: We present a modular and
                  user-extensible pipeline called Sunbeam that performs these
                  steps in a consistent and reproducible fashion. It can be
                  installed in a single step, does not require administrative
                  access to the host computer system, and can work with most
                  cluster computing frameworks. We also introduce Komplexity, a
                  software tool to eliminate potentially problematic,
                  low-complexity nucleotide sequences from metagenomic data. A
                  unique component of the Sunbeam pipeline is an easy-to-use
                  extension framework that enables users to add custom
                  processing or analysis steps directly to the workflow. The
                  pipeline and its extension framework are well documented, in
                  routine use, and regularly updated. CONCLUSIONS: Sunbeam
                  provides a foundation to build more in-depth analyses and to
                  enable comparisons in metagenomic sequencing experiments by
                  removing problematic, low-complexity reads and standardizing
                  post-processing and analytical steps. Sunbeam is written in
                  Python using the Snakemake workflow management software and is

                  science technologies but also one that has arguably the
                  broadest set of applications and impacts globally.
                  Metagenomics has found vast utility not only in environmental
                  sciences, ecology, and public health but also in clinical
                  medicine and looking into the future, in planetary health. In
                  line with the One Health concept, metagenomics solicits
                  collaboration between molecular biologists, geneticists,
                  microbiologists, clinicians, computational biologists, plant
                  biologists, veterinarians, and other health care
                  professionals. Almost every ecological niche of our planet
                  hosts an extremely diverse community of organisms that are
                  still poorly characterized. Detailed characterization of the

                  rRNA genes has long been used to investigate community
                  membership and taxonomic abundance in microbiome studies. As
                  we can observe, shotgun metagenomics has become the dominant
                  method in this field. This is largely owing to advancements in
                  sequencing technology, which now allow for random sequencing
                  of the entire genetic content of a microbiome. Furthermore,
                  this method allows profiling both genes and the microbiome's
                  membership. Although these methods have provided extensive
                  insights into various microbiomes, they solely assess the
                  existence of organisms or genes, without determining their
                  active role within the microbiome. Microbiome scholarship now
                  includes metatranscriptomics to decipher how a community of
                  microorganisms responds to changing environmental conditions
                  over a period of time. Metagenomic studies identify the
                  microbes that make up a community but metatranscriptomics
                  explores the diversity of active genes within that community,
                  understanding their expression profile and observing how these
                  genes respond to changes in environmental conditions. This
                  expert review article offers a critical examination of the
                  computational metatranscriptomics tools for studying the
                  transcriptomes of microbial communities. First, we unpack the

                  we explore the prospects and challenges of metatranscriptomic
                  workflows, starting with isolation and sequencing of the RNA
                  community, then moving on to bioinformatics approaches for
                  quantifying RNA features, and statistical techniques for
                  detecting differential expression in a community. Finally, we
                  discuss strengths and shortcomings in relation to other
                  microbiome analysis approaches, pipelines, use cases and
                  limitations, and contextualize metatranscriptomics as a tool

                  microbial communities, but it can only capture few abundant
                  organisms from most metagenomes. Here we present MetaPhlAn 4,
                  which integrates information from metagenome assemblies and
                  microbial isolate genomes for more comprehensive metagenomic
                  taxonomic profiling. From a curated collection of 1.01 M
                  prokaryotic reference and metagenome-assembled genomes, we
                  define unique marker genes for 26,970 species-level genome
                  bins, 4,992 of them taxonomically unidentified at the species
                  level. MetaPhlAn 4 explains ~20\% more reads in most
                  international human gut microbiomes and >40\% in
                  less-characterized environments such as the rumen microbiome
                  and proves more accurate than available alternatives on
                  synthetic evaluations while also reliably quantifying
                  organisms with no cultured isolates. Application of the method
                  to >24,500 metagenomes highlights previously undetected
                  species to be strong biomarkers for host conditions and
                  lifestyles in human and mouse microbiomes and shows that even
                  previously uncharacterized species can be genetically profiled
                  at the resolution of single microbial strains.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Modern sequencing technologies offer extraordinary
                  opportunities for virus discovery and virome analysis.
                  Annotation of viral sequences from metagenomic data requires a
                  complex series of steps to ensure accurate annotation of
                  individual reads and assembled contigs. In addition, varying
                  study designs will require project-specific statistical
                  analyses. FINDINGS: Here we introduce Hecatomb, a
                  bioinformatic platform coordinating commonly used tasks
                  required for virome analysis. Hecatomb means "a great
                  sacrifice." In this setting, Hecatomb is "sacrificing"
                  false-positive viral annotations using extensive quality
                  control and tiered-database searches. Hecatomb processes
                  metagenomic data obtained from both short- and long-read
                  sequencing technologies, providing annotations to individual
                  sequences and assembled contigs. Results are provided in
                  commonly used data formats useful for downstream analysis.
                  Here we demonstrate the functionality of Hecatomb through the
                  reanalysis of a primate enteric and a novel coral reef virome.
                  CONCLUSION: Hecatomb provides an integrated platform to manage
                  many commonly used steps for virome characterization,
                  including rigorous quality control, host removal, and both
                  read- and contig-based analysis. Each step is managed using
                  the Snakemake workflow manager with dependency management
                  using Conda. Hecatomb outputs several tables properly
                  formatted for immediate use within popular data analysis and
                  visualization tools, enabling effective data interpretation
                  for a variety of study designs. Hecatomb is hosted on GitHub
                  (github.com/shandley/hecatomb) and is available for
                  installation from Bioconda and PyPI.},
