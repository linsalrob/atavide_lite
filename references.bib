  abstract = "Motivation: Quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are
              essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis.
              Traditionally, a different tool is used for each operation, such
              as quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These
              tools are often insufficiently fast as most are developed using
              high-level programming languages (e.g. Python and Java) and
              provide limited multi-threading support. Reading and loading data
              multiple times also renders preprocessing slow and I/O
              inefficient. Results: We developed fastp as an ultra-fast FASTQ
              preprocessor with useful quality control and data-filtering
              features. It can perform quality control, adapter trimming,
              quality filtering, per-read quality pruning and many other
              operations with a single scan of the FASTQ data. This tool is
              developed in C++ and has multi-threading support. Based on our
              evaluation, fastp is 2-5 times faster than other FASTQ
              preprocessing tools such as Trimmomatic or Cutadapt despite
              performing far more operations than similar tools. Availability

              produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in
              style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the
              format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are
              released. SAMtools implements various utilities for
              post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing,
              variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal
              tools for processing read alignments. AVAILABILITY:

              ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA
              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate
              ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly
              contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of
              megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
              concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces
              new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as
              fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and
              is $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers

              Here we develop variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning
              (VAMB), a program that uses deep variational autoencoders to
              encode sequence coabundance and k-mer distribution information

              to integrate these two distinct data types without any previous
              knowledge of the datasets. VAMB outperforms existing
              state-of-the-art binners, reconstructing 29-98\% and 45\% more
              near-complete (NC) genomes on simulated and real data,

              related strains up to 99.5\% average nucleotide identity (ANI),
